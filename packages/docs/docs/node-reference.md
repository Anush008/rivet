# Rivet Node Reference

This section of the Rivet documentation goes over the different nodes available in Rivet.

If you are just getting started, consider going through the [Tutorial](./tutorial), which introduces the more common node types in a structured way. For an overview of manipulating nodes in the Rivet UI, see [Working with Nodes](./user-guide/adding-connecting-nodes).
